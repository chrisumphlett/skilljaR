## First package submission

* This package is an API wrapper for Skilljar. Based on searches for "skilljar" across all of Github, and CRAN, I do not believe that anyone has developed an R wrapper for the Skilljar API.

## Test environments

* Developed on and tested with Windows 10, R 4.1
* Tested on R-devel with devtools::check_win_devel()
* Testing against multiple Linux platforms with devtools::check_rhub()

## R CMD check results
