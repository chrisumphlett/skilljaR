## R CMD check results
*Below is a placeholder*
0 errors √ | 1 warning x | 0 notes √

The warning can be ignored from what I have read, it has to do with the vignette. I only want to create an html vignette but there is a warning about a PDF.

WARNING
  'qpdf' is needed for checks on size reduction of PDFs

## No reverse dependencies
